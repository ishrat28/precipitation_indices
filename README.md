# precipitation_indices
The WMO (World Meteorological Organization) and the WCRP (World Climate Research Program) collaborate to form the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI), 
which paves the way to investigate regional and global climatic extremes. 
Trends of extreme indices have been employed in the study by Dollan et al. (2022) Investigating Temporal and Spatial Precipitation Patterns in the Southern Mid-Atlantic United States

Dollan et al. (2022) Seasonal variability of future extreme precipitation and associated trends across the Contiguous U.S. also uses the ETCCDI indices by leveraging the large ensemble of Community Earth System Model V2 (CESM2-LE). https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fclim.2022.954892/full
